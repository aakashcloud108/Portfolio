# 🌐 My Online Portfolio

## Hi, I'm Aakash! 👋
This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website.
It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will be deployed using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) through Azure DevOps Pipelines.

The goal of this project is not only to host my portfolio online but also to document the entire process of setting up CI/CD pipelines, containerization, and cloud deployment step by step.

I will be documenting each step of my journey here as I move forward with building and deploying this project.
