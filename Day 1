My Online Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and will be deployed using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) through Azure DevOps Pipelines.
I am documenting each step of the process as I build and deploy this project, so this README serves as both project documentation and a learning journal.

üìñ Progress Log

Initial Setup: Created a simple portfolio site with HTML, CSS, and JS. Uploaded source code to GitHub.

Pipeline Setup: Connected GitHub repo with Azure DevOps pipelines for automated deployment into AKS.

Current Issue:

Encountered error:

##[error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted.  
To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form:  
https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request


Cause: Private projects on Azure DevOps don‚Äôt get free parallelism by default.

Action: Need to request permission from Azure to enable free parallelism.
